# test.nvim

WIP neovim plugin for testing

### The issue

List of things I want this plugin to do (not definitive)

 - Run tests:
    - Unified way of executing tests across frameworks and languages
    - Test suite/class/method
    - Rerun test (test last)
    - Rerun only failed tests
    - Watch code (rerun tests upon changes)
 - Quickfixlist:
    - Parse output correctly
 - Show tests (ui):
    - Show tests as a tree
    - Show progress
 - Goto tests
    - Goto tests (telescope/fzf prompt would be cool)
    - Find tests for this class/method (code lens maybe)
 - Frameworks:
    - Grade
    - Rspec
    - Jest
